            While the early 2022 version was functional, I wasn't happy with the
            design. I'm currently working on a new responsive JamStack static
            site version of this design using 11ty and Numjucks. It's a fun
            puzzle taking this new design and creating a site that will
            automatically update when I post a new article or project either as
            a markdown (.md) file in or though Netlify CMS.
          </p>

          <p class="article-body">
            The new site will have added accessibilty features including a skip
            to main content for screen readers. In 2023, a theme switcher will
            be added so readers can choose from at least a dark or light theme,
            and eventually to large print and/or high contrast.
          </p>
          <p class="article-body">
            Note: I'm aware that this 'under rennovation' version isn't
            responsive. I'm focusing my time on replying to inquires by multiple recruiters and prospective clients as well as getting the full, responsive static generated site live.
